I break things, fix things, automate everything, and talk about it on YouTube.  

My world revolves around cybersecurity, blue team defense, Linux, homelabbing, radio comms, and building tools that make tech *less painful* and *more secure.*

In my free time, I'm a content creator dedicated to educating the community and the next generation of tech and cybersecurity professionals through hands-on tutorials, security breakdowns, and open-source projects.

If you like cybersecurity automation, homelab engineering, decentralized social media, or Linux on the desktop then you're in the right place.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Engineering

- **Cybersecurity Engineer (CISSP)** working across IAM, EDR, SOAR, ZTNA, SASE, and cloud security  
- **Primarily self-taught** with almost no formal education just homelabbing, curiosity, and hands-on experience  
- Builder of security bots that detect typosquat domains, service outages, RFM devices, and more  
- Advocate of end-to-end encryption, zero trust, and owning your infrastructure  
- Firm believer in right to repair and privacy rights  
- Passionate about threat modeling, OSINT, and telecommunications security (SS7, IMSI catchers, Stingrays)

**My Linux Setup:**  
**Daily Drivers:** Pop!_OS, Parrot OS, and Debian  
**Hardware:** Hand-built desktops + laptops by Tuxedo Computers, System76, and MNT  
**Server OS:** Ubuntu for production servers  
**Enterprise Experience:** Comfortable with RHEL-based distros (Rocky, AlmaLinux, CentOS) from work

## 🧪 My Home Lab Stack

Building, breaking, and learning in a production-grade home lab environment:

- **pfSense** + **Suricata** IDS/IPS + **pfBlockerNG** on VLAN-segmented networks  
- **Grafana** dashboards for SIEM monitoring of pfSense, Unifi switches & APs, and infrastructure metrics  
- **FrankenLLM Server** running dual GPUs: Nvidia RTX 5060Ti 16GB and Nvidia RTX 3050 8GB for simultaneous multi-model AI inference  
- **Single Board Computers (SBCs)** for power-efficient computing: Raspberry Pi (4 & 5), Pine64, and various other devices  
- **Coming soon:** 5× Pi 5 Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration and bot infrastructure  
- **Second-hand PCs** repurposed whenever possible to reduce e-waste and promote sustainability  
- **Synology NAS** with NUT (Network UPS Tools) monitoring and notifications  
- **Meshtastic nodes**, LoRa experiments, and custom antenna builds  
- **SDR (Software Defined Radio):** ADS-B aircraft tracking, UAT weather, and RF signal analysis  
- **Self-hosted services:** Mastodon instance, Matrix homeserver, BlueSky PDS (coming soon), link aggregator, and more

This lab isn't just a playground, it's a learning platform where I test security tools, practice incident response, and develop automation that I share with the community. I prioritize energy efficiency and sustainability by using SBCs and repurposed hardware wherever practical.
